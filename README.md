## Description
Smart Cards is a C# ASP.NET MVC website that enables students to view flashcard sets generated by their teachers and use ChatGPT to help them study terms. The website provides an interactive and efficient way for students to study and review important concepts, with the added benefit of having a powerful AI language model available to assist them in answering questions and clarifying any confusion. Teachers also have the ability to view reports about sets, including views, ratings, and comments.

# Install

At one point, the website and database were hosted by Azure, but for now the project is archived. It currently uses a SQLite server, and the AI functionality doesn't work because that needs a paid API key. But, you can still play around with it and get the general idea.

1. Download latest .NET 6 SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) - pick the right one for your device
1. Open the download on your device and follow the instructions
1.  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/zgstumpf/smartcards.git
    cd smartcards
    dotnet ef database update
    dotnet run
    ```
1. Search https://localhost:7175 in your browser
1. Make an account on the website (email doesn't need to be real, make sure to click on the link to verify your email, then log in with your new credentials)
1. By default, new users are students. Other teachers can promote a student to a teacher. Since there are no teachers yet, you have to manually make yourself a teacher to get things started.
1. Open **smartcards-dev.sqlite** in a SQLite explorer, such as SQLiteStudio, and run the following SQL:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO AspNetUserRoles
    VALUES
    (
        (
        -- There is only one user
        SELECT
            id
        FROM
            AspNetUsers
        ),
        (
        SELECT
            id
        FROM
            AspNetRoles
        WHERE
            name = "Teacher"
        )
    );
    ```
1. Log out and log back in, and you will be a teacher.
